          <p><br>I am currently a 3rd year Software Engineering Student who is attending 
             University of California, Irvine. I thoroughly enjoy discovering the abilities
             of what Software Engineering could achieve, creating, and problem-solving. 
             Throughout my high school years, I've always been fasincated with what other
             programmers are able to do. After exploring the surface of programming in
             college and building small programs, I wanted to further pursue this field
             as a career.<br>
             <br>In my career as a Software Developer, I want to focus more on back-end development
             while also learning about web and app development.<br>
             <br>Outside of coding, I'll either be drawing, playing video games, and hanging 
             out with my loved ones.<br>
